<h1>Easy Use<a class="headerlink" href="#easy-use" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>As mentioned on the main page, Exordium does not really attempt to be
a general-purpose web music library suitable for widespread use.  The
only configuration options currently available are those necessary for
basic operation.  Exordium was born out of my persistent
dissatisfaction with existing web music library applications.  I&#8217;ve
been using various library applications over the years but have always
ended up maintaining my own patchsets to alter their behavior to suit
what I like, and in the end I figured it would be more rewarding to
just write my own.</p>
<p>So, Exordium represents essentially my own personal ideal of a web
music library application, and its design decisions and operational
goals reflect a very specific set of requirements: my own.  If your
ideal music library differs from my own in even moderate ways, other
music library apps are much more likely to be to your liking.</p>
<p>I would, of course, be happy to accept patches which add, extend, or
modify Exordium behavior, so long as the current functionality remains
the default.  I certainly don&#8217;t actually <em>expect</em> any patches, of course,
given that Exordium&#8217;s target market is exactly one individual.</p>
<div class="section" id="assumptions">
<h2>Assumptions<a class="headerlink" href="#assumptions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">Except for the Javascript necessary to hook into jPlayer, and jPlayer
itself, there is no client-side Javascript or AJAX-style dynamic page
content.  All HTML is generated server-side.  The application is
quite usable from text-based browsers.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Music files must be accessible via the local filesystem on which Django
is running, and stored as either mp3, ogg vorbis, or m4a (mp4a).</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">The entire music library must be available from a single directory
prefix.  If subdirs of this root dir span multiple volumes (or network
mounts), that&#8217;s fine, but there is NO support for multiple libraries in
Exordium.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Exordium itself will never attempt to write to your library directory for
any reason - all music files (and album art) are managed outside of
this app.  Write access to a directory on the filesystem is required
for zipfile downloads, but that directory need not be in your music
library.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Music files should be, in general, arranged scrupulously: All files
within a single directory belong to the same album, and an album should
never span multiple directories.  There&#8217;s actually plenty of wiggle room
here, and Exordium should correctly deal with directories full of
&#8220;miscellaneous&#8221; files, etc, but in general the library should be
well-ordered and have albums contained in their own directories.  This
is less important during the initial library import, but becomes much
more important when updating tags or rearranging your filesystem layout,
as Exordium uses the directory structure to help determine what kind of
changes have been made.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Directory containment is the primary method through which Various Artists
albums are collated.  A group of files in the same directory with different
artists but the same album name will be sorted into a single &#8220;Various&#8221;
album containing all those tracks.  Conversely, if an album name is shared
by tracks from different directories (each dir&#8217;s files with a different
artist name), multiple albums will be created.</li>
<li>Tracks without an album tag will be sorted into a &#8220;virtual&#8221; album entitled
&#8220;Non-Album Tracks: Band Name&#8221; - this is the one case where it&#8217;s expected that
this virtual &#8220;album&#8221; might span multiple directories.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p class="first">The artwork for albums should be contained in gif/jpg/png files stored
alongside the mp3s/oggs/m4as, or in the immediate parent folder (in the case
of multi-disc albums, for instance).  Filenames which start with &#8220;cover&#8221;
will be preferred over other graphics in the directory.  PNGs will be
preferred over JPGs, and JPGs will be preferred over GIFs.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Artwork thumbnails will be stored directly in Django&#8217;s database, in
blatant disregard for Django best practices.  IMO the benefits far
outweigh the performance concerns, given the scale of data involved.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Music files should be available directly via HTTP/HTTPS, using the same
directory structure as the library.  This does not have to be on the same
port or even server as Django, but the direct download and streaming
functionality rely on having a direct URL to the files.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Album zipfile downloads, similarly, require that the zipfile directory be
accessible directly over the web.  As with the music files, this does not
need to be on the same port or even server as Django, but Django will not
serve the zipfile itself.  The reason for this is that I want to be able
to pass the zipfile URL to other apps for downloading, and for downloads
to be easily resumable in the event they&#8217;re accidentally cancelled before
they&#8217;re finished.  The text on the download page mentions that zipfiles
are kept for around 48 hours, but that cleanup is actually not a function
of Exordium itself.  Instead, I just have a cronjob set on the box like so:</p>

</pre></div>
</div>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Tags for information commonly associated with classical music are
supported, namely: Group/Ensemble, Conductor, and Composer.  <em>(For ID3
tags: TPE2, TPE3, and TCOM, respectively.  In Ogg Vorbis, the more
sensible ENSEMBLE, CONDUCTOR, and COMPOSER.)</em>  Albums will still be
defined by their main Artist/Album association, and Artist is
always a required field, whereas Group/Conductor/Composer are all
optional.  Internally, these are all stored as &#8220;artists,&#8221; so when
browsing by artist, Exordium should do the right thing and show you
all albums containing an artist, whether they showed up as artist,
composer, conductor, or ensemble.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">There are many live concert recordings in my personal library, which I&#8217;ve
uniformly tagged with an album name starting with &#8220;YYYY.MM.DD - Live&#8221;.
Given the volume of these albums, Exordium will automatically consider any
album matching that name as a &#8220;live&#8221; album.  <em>(Dashes and underscores are
also acceptable inbetween the date components.)</em>  By default, Exordium
will hide those live albums from its display, since they otherwise often
get in the way.  A checkbox is available in the lefthand column to turn
on live album display, though, and it can be toggled at any time.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">The &#8220;addition date&#8221; of albums into the library is an important data point;
Exordium&#8217;s main view is the twenty most recently-added albums.  To that
point, updates of the music files will allow the album records to be
updated while keeping the addition time intact.  Some specific cases in
which this is ensured:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Updating album/artist names in the file&#8217;s tags</li>
<li>Moving music files from one directory to another, or renaming the files</li>
</ul>
<p>Combining the two may, however, result in the album being deleted from
the library and then re-added.  If the tags on a collection of files are
updated (so that the file&#8217;s checksum changes), <strong>and</strong> the files are
moved into a separate directory, the album will end up being re-added,
since there&#8217;s no reasonable way to associate the updated files with the
old ones.</p>
<p>The most common case of that would be if there was a typo in the album
or artist name for an album, and that typo was replicated in the directory
structure containing the files.  Fixing the typo would involve changing
both the tags and the directory names.  In order to keep the addition time
intact in this case, you would have to perform both steps separately, running
an update after each one.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="limitations">
<h2>Limitations<a class="headerlink" href="#limitations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>There are some inherent limitations of Exordium, based on the assumptions
that have been made during its development (and in my own music library).</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The artist name &#8220;Various&#8221; is reserved.  Tracks with an artist tag of
&#8220;Various&#8221; will not be added to the library.</li>
<li>Artist and Trackname tags are required.  Tracks will not be added to
the library if either of those tags are missing.</li>
<li>If two Various Artists albums with the same album name exist in the
library, they&#8217;ll end up stored as one single album in the DB.</li>
<li>If two directories contain files which seem to be in the same album (by
the same artist), you&#8217;ll end up with an album which spans directories.
Behavior may not be well-defined in that case.</li>
<li>Exordium completely ignores genre tags.  I&#8217;ve personally always been
lousy at putting reasonable values in there on my media, and so that&#8217;s
been very unimportant to me.  It&#8217;d probably be good to support them
anyway, though.</li>
<li>Exordium only supports mp3, ogg, and m4a currently, though other
support should be reasonably simple to add in, so long as Mutagen
supports the format.</li>
<li>m4a tags don&#8217;t seem to allow for Ensemble or Conductor, so that data
will never be present for m4a files.  (If support for those tags is
in there somewhere, I&#8217;d like to hear about it.)</li>
</ul>
